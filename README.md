Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the companyâ€™s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment. The Customer Personality Analysis project effectively employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data, resulting in a more concise and meaningful representation. Utilizing the KMeans Clustering algorithm, the data was successfully grouped into five distinct clusters, providing valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. The selection of the optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method, ensuring a well-defined and interpretable clustering solution. This approach enables businesses to gain deeper understanding of their customer base, tailor marketing strategies, and enhance customer experience, ultimately leading to improved decision-making and business growth.
